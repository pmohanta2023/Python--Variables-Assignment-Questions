    "Q1. Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable. \n",
    "Ans: When declaring a variable, there are several conventions that are commonly followed in programming. These conventions help improve code readability and maintainability. Here are some of the conventions:\n",
    "1.Use meaningful and descriptive names.\n",
    "2.Use camel case or snake case.\n",
    "3.Avoid using reserved keywords.\n",
    "4.Start with a letter or underscore.\n",
    "5.Follow a consistent naming convention.\n",
    "6.Use lowercase for variable names.\n",
    "7.Be concise but not overly abbreviated.\n",
    "8.Use meaningful abbreviations.\n",
    "9.Use nouns for most variables.\n",
    "10.Avoid single-letter names.\n",
    "11.Avoid Hungarian notation.\n",
    "Q2. What will happen if we declare a restricted keyword as a variable? \n",
    "Ans: If we declare a restricted keyword as a variable, it will result in a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Can we actually declare a string as a variable name?\n",
    "Ans: No, in Python, we cannot declare a string as a variable name directly. According to Python's syntax rules, variable names must follow certain conventions and restrictions.\n",
    "Here are some examples of valid variable names in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_variable\n",
    "userName\n",
    "count\n",
    "_internal_variable\n",
    "Q4. Is it possible for us to declare “_” as a variable? If so, then write an example of it.\n",
    "Ans: Yes, in Python, it is possible to declare a variable with the name \"_\". The underscore \"_\" is a valid variable name and can be used to represent a temporary or throwaway variable.\n",
    "Here's an example of declaring and using a variable named \"_\":\n",
    "_ = 10\n",
    "print(_)  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    " Q5. Using an example, explain how the variables in python are dynamic in nature.\n",
    "In Python, variables are dynamic in nature, which means they can change their type and value during the execution of a program. This flexibility allows for dynamic programming and makes Python a dynamically-typed language.\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the dynamic nature of variables in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 5 \n",
    "x = \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: Hello \n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n"
